Please only look at the Main Homepage, About page, and Events pages, as those are the only pages that we are submitting.
In the navigation bar, you can click on the buttons in the top bar to navigate to the different pages. Anytime you leave the home page, you can also return to it by clicking on the Dream Factory icon.
If you shrink the width of your window, then the top bar will adjust so that you can still click on all of the options. You can also click on the Donate and Refer A Child buttons to take you to the corresponding pages. 

The About page contains information about the Dream Factory website. The events page is a template where Dream Factory members will eventually be able to post about their events in an organized fashion. The members will eventually be able to post about their future events as well as their old ones.

Pictures and text used on this website were taken from the Dream Factory St. Louis chapter and the overall Dream Factory website (dreamfactoryinc.org)
