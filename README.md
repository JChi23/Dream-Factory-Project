Please only look at the About page, and Donation Page, as those are the only pages that we are submitting for Dream Factory Team 2.
In the navigation bar, you can click on the buttons in the top bar to navigate to the different pages. Anytime you leave the home page, you can also return to it by clicking on the Dream Factory icon.
If you shrink the width of your window, then the top bar will adjust so that you can still click on all of the options. 

We routed the site pages in app.module.ts

Pictures and text used on this website were taken from the Dream Factory St. Louis chapter and the overall Dream Factory website (dreamfactoryinc.org)
